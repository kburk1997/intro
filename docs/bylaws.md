# Bylaws

Our Bylaws are an extension of our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). The Bylaws apply to RCOS meetings at RPI, including large group and small group meetings as well as bonus sessions, casual coding sessions, and any project meetings unless otherwise noted.

## Attendance Codes
Attendance codes are given during all RCOS small group, large group, and bonus sessions. When the attendance code is delivered, go to http://rcos.io, click "Attend", and enter the attendance code so you can be marked as present for the current session.

As much as we value sharing and openness, we also value integrity. Thus, we ask that you do not distribute attendance codes to people who are not currently attending the session. If you are caught distributing attendance codes to people who are absent, **both your attendance code as well as the attendance code(s) you distributed to others will be nullified**.

If you know in advance you will not be able to make an RCOS meeting, or unforeseen circumstances arise that make you unable to attend, please review our [Excused Absence Policy]() instead of attempting to enter an attendance code.

## Noise
An important part of RCOS is being able to hear from both fellow RCOS members and guest speakers. We ask that you please refrain from talking or making excessive noise while a speaker is talking as it can be disruptive to the speaker and to your peers.

## During Large Group
During our large group sessions, we have the following policies.

### Presentations on Sensitive Topics (full policy TBD)
<!-- NOTE: this policy may be already implicit, but it may be necessary as we stray into more traditionally off-topic talks. This guideline is not set in stone, feel free to remove or revise if necessary. See comments in source code for more commentary. -->

Please keep in mind that RCOS large group sessions are mandatory for all students currently in RCOS. Presentations containing detailed discussion of sensitive, upsetting, or controversial topics without warning can create an especially hostile environment when this attendance requirement is considered. 

<!--TODO: flesh out specifics of "sensitive topics".
Preliminary list may include things like sex, violence, bigotry, drugs/alcohol, death, trauma, serious physical or mental illness, etc. However, it might be better to deal with these things on a case-by-case basis. E.g. a talk on inclusive sex education should be handled much differently than explicit and graphic discussion of pornography

[//]: # (Possible options for sensitive topics shall they arise:)
[//]: # (- Keep any mention of sensitive topics brief, respectful, and non-descript in nature)
[//]: # (- Link to further reading on material, providing appropriate content warnings and resources for help dealing with such topics/triggers if necessary)
[//]: # (- Consider whether talk would be more appropriate as a non-mandatory session where students can easily pick an alternate activity)
[//]: # (- Touch base with a coordinator or faculty member to further discuss options for your talk)-->

### Laptops/Mobile Devices
RCOS likes to maintain a culture of freedom. If you choose to use your laptop or mobile device during large group presentations, you may do so as long as you are mindful of the people around you. This includes:

* Muting all audio
* Not participating in audio or video calls
* Ensuring any material that may be visible on your screen is SFW (safe for work)
* Keeping mobile devices on "Silent" or "Vibrate"
* Using your device's keyboard instead of a mechanical keyboard

In addition, some speakers may ask audience members to close all laptops and put away all mobile devices. If a speaker does so, please respect their request.

If you absolutely must take a phone call, you can exit the lecture hall to make/take a phone call. If you need to call emergency services for any reason, you may remain in the room while you make the call.

If you use assistive technology due to a documented disability or injury, or you use a medical device that may make noise or looks similar in appearance to a mobile phone or laptop, **please touch base with a faculty member ASAP**. This will remain confidential.

## Consequences of Code of Conduct Violations
If you violate the RCOS Community Code of Conduct or Bylaws, appropriate consequences will follow at the discretion of faculty. These may include:

* A verbal or Slack warning from a mentor or coordinator
* A written warning from a faculty member
* A request to edit or delete any blog posts, code, comments, issues, pull requests, milestones, wiki pages, social media posts, etc. that violate the Code of Conduct
* If your large group talk or bonus session violates the Code of Conduct, your talk may be ended early and your slides will not be published to the #slides channel.
* If the violation occurred at an RCOS event or meeting, you may be removed from the event or meeting. This will be marked as an unexcused absence regardless of whether or not you already entered an attendance code, and you will not be able to make up this absence by attending a bonus session.
* In severe and repeated violations, you may be removed from RCOS entirely. 
  * If you are taking RCOS for credit, you will receive a failing grade for the semester. 
  * If you are currently a mentor, your mentorship position will be terminated immediately and you will be ineligible to mentor in future semesters. The same rule applies to coordinators.

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive and additional consequences may follow as appropriate.
